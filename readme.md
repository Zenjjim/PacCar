Newton's laws of motion: Apply Newton's laws to calculate the rectangle's acceleration, velocity, and position based on the forces acting on it (e.g., engine force, friction, and drag).

Friction: Implement both static and kinetic friction between the rectangle and the ground to simulate the grip of the tires. This will affect how easily the rectangle starts to drift and how it responds to the player's inputs.

Traction: Differentiate between the grip of the front and rear "tires" (the rectangle's shorter sides) by modifying friction coefficients. This will help create more realistic drifting behavior.

Weight transfer: Simulate the effect of weight transfer during acceleration, braking, and cornering. This can have a significant impact on the rectangle's grip and drifting behavior.

Aerodynamics: Implement drag force to simulate air resistance, which can affect the rectangle's top speed and acceleration.

Collision response: Add collision detection and response between the rectangle and the environment (e.g., walls or other objects), so the rectangle behaves realistically when it collides with other objects.
